"""Unit tests for docman.

This directory contains isolated unit tests for individual functions and components.
Unit tests should mock external dependencies and focus on testing business logic
in isolation (e.g., parsers, validators, formatters, data transformations).

For integration tests that test full command execution, see tests/integration/.
